Hi! Iâ€™m an undergraduate student pursuing a B.S. degree in Computer Science, focusing on Artificial Intelligence at [New York University Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/) and [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/). I currently work as a Research Assistant at [New York University Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/), mentored by [Prof. Hongyi Wen](https://whongyi.github.io/) and [Prof. Shengjie Wang](https://sheng-jie-wang.github.io/). My research interests lie in personalized and responsible AI. Here are some topics that I have worked on:

1. **Image-LoRA Personalization**: A training-free method for personalizing diffusion models by editing LoRA weights in the latent space.

2. **Machine Unlearning for LLMs**: Developing methods to remove harmful and unwanted content from large language models through parameter-efficient unlearning techniques.

Feel free to reach out to me via email if you're interested in my projects, research areas, or just want to connect!
